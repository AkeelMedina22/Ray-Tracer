# About the Project

This is the final project #2 from CS 440 Computer Graphics, offered at Habib University at Fall 2021.

It is a fully functional ray tracer built using C++, following the book Ray Tracing from the Ground Up by Kevin Suffern. The details are given through the accompanying website.
